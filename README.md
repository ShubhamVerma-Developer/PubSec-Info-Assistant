# Information Assistant Accelerator

This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and retrieval.

> **NOTICE:** This codebase relies on the Azure OpenAI Service which must be procured first separately, subject to any applicable license agreement. Access to this code does not grant you a license or right to use Azure OpenAI Service. You can request access [here](https://aka.ms/oaiapply).

# Getting Started


## Prerequisites

---

The IA Accelerator requires a variety of services in Azure. There are a few prerequisites required to deploy and configure the IA Accelerator. Please obtain these items first before continuing on to the deployment section of this guide.

>To get started with the ISt Accelerator you will need the following:
>
>* An active Azure Subscription *
>* Administrative rights on the Azure Subscription
>
>\* *The Azure Subscription needs to be a paid subscription. While you can create a free tier of any of the Cognitive Services, you can only create one free Cognitive Service in an account so the trial would therefore not be able to handle all of the services in this example.*

You can sign up for an Azure subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). Once you have your prerequisite items, please move on to the Deployment Configuration step.

## Deployment Configuration

The deployment process for the IA Accelerator, uses a concept of **Developing inside a Container** to containerize all the necessary pre-requisite component without requiring them to be installed on the local machine. The environment you will work in will be created using a development container, or dev container, hosted on a virtual machine using GitHub Codespaces.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/PubSec-Info-Assistant)

Begin by setting up your own Codespace using our  [Developing in a Codespaces](docs/developing_in_a_codespaces.md) documentation.

*More information can be found at [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).*

Once you have the completed the setting up Codespaces, please move on to the Sizing Estimation step.

# Sizing Estimator

 The IA Accelerator needs to be sized appropriately based on your use case. Please review our [Sizing Estimator](./docs/costestimator.md) to help find the configuration that fits your needs.

Once you have completed the Sizing Estimator, please move on to the Deployment steps.

# Deployment

There are several steps to deploying the IA Accelerator. The following checklist will guide you through configuring the IS Assistant Accelerator in your environments. Please follow the steps in the order they are provided as values from one step may be used in subsequent steps.

>1. Configure Local Development Environment
>       * [Configuring your Development Environment](/docs/development_environment.md)
>1. Configure Azure resources
>       * [Configure Azure resources](/infra/README.md)
