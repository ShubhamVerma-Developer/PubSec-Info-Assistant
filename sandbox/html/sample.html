    <h1>The Evolution of Renewable Energy Sources</h1>
    <h2>By: Your Name</h2>
    <p>Date: Today's Date</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The world's dependence on fossil fuels has been a topic of concern for several decades, but the push for renewable energy has been gaining momentum in recent years. The concept of renewable energy is not new; early civilizations found ways to harness the power of nature for their own use. This document will cover the evolution of renewable energy sources from its early days to modern times.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Early Uses of Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p>Wind, water, and solar power are considered some of the earliest forms of renewable energy. These energy sources were used in unique ways by ancient civilizations. Below is a table showcasing some of these uses:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Energy Source</th>
            <th>Ancient Civilization</th>
            <th>Use</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Wind</td>
            <td>Ancient Egypt</td>
            <td>Sailing Ships</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Water</td>
            <td>Ancient Rome</td>
            <td>Watermills</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Solar</td>
            <td>Ancient Greece</td>
            <td>Heating homes</td>
        </tr>

    <h2>Chapter 2: The Industrial Revolution and Energy</h2>
    <p>With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the demand for energy surged. The invention of the steam engine and the widespread use of coal altered the energy landscape dramatically. Unfortunately, the environmental repercussions were not fully understood at the time.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 3: The Age of Oil and the Rise of Fossil Fuels</h2>
    <p>In the late 19th and 20th centuries, oil became the dominant source of energy. Its applications in various industries and transportation sectors led to an increase in demand. However, the negative environmental impacts associated with burning fossil fuels started to become more evident towards the end of the 20th century.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 4: The Resurgence of Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p>Recognizing the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources, the world began to focus again on renewable energy in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Solar and wind power, in particular, have seen significant advancements and are increasingly used around the globe.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The journey of renewable energy is far from over. With increasing technological advancements and a heightened focus on sustainability, the use of renewable energy sources is expected to rise. The past teaches us valuable lessons about the power of renewable resources, and the future holds promise for even greater advancements in this field.</p>
