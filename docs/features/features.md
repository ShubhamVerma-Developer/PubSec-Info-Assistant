## Document Pre-processing

The Information Assistant Accelerator pre-processes certain document types to allow better understanding of large complex documents. Currently we apply special processing on:

* PDF
* HTML
* DOCX

For more details on how we process each document type click on on the document type in the list above.

We also log the status of the pre-processing in Azure Cosmos DB. View our [Status Logging](../../functions/shared_code/status_log.md) page for more details.
