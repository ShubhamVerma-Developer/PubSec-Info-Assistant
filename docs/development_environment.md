# Configure Local Development Environment

Follow these steps to get the accelerator up and running in a subscription of your choice.

## Clone Repo

The first step will be to clone the Git repo into your Ubuntu 22.04 WSL environment. To do this:

>1. In GitHub, on the Source Tab select **<> Code** and get the HTTPS Clone path.
>2. Launch VSCode. Open the Ubuntu 22.04(WSL) Terminal.
>3. Make sure you are in the root folder by running the following command from the bash command prompt
>
>   ``` bash
>      cd ~
>   ```
>
>4. Run the following command from the bash command prompt
>
>   ``` bash
>       git clone <repo url> infoasst
>   ```
>
This will now have created the **infoasst** folder on your Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment.

## Open Code in Development Container

The next step is to open the source code and build the dev container. To do this you will:

1. Log into Azure using the Azure CLI
2. Open the cloned source code into VSCode
3. Launch and connect to the development container from VSCode

### Log into Azure using the Azure CLI

---

We will use the bash prompt from the previous step to issue the following commands:

``` bash
    az login
```

This will launch a browser session where you can complete you login.

Next from the bash prompt run:

``` bash
    az account show
```

The output here should show that you're logged into the intended Azure subscription.  If this isn't showing the right subscription then you can list all the subscriptions you have access to with:

``` bash
    az account list
```

From this output, grab the Subscription ID of the subscription you intend to deploy to and run:

``` bash
    az account set --subscription mysubscription
```

### Open the cloned source code into VSCode

---

Next, open the folder in VS Code by running the following commands:

``` bash
    cd infoasst
    code .
```

This will navigate into the infoasst folder and open a new VSCode window focused on that folder.

### Launch and connect to the development container from VSCode

---

As the new VSCode window opens you may notice a dialog in the lower right corner that indicates there is a development container in the source location. Click on the **Reopen in Container** button.

Don't worry if you miss the dialog, we can also do this from the Command Pallete in VS Code. Launch the Command Pallete from **View > Command Pallete** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**. From the Command Pallete prompt enter **Dev Containers: Open workspace in container**

VSCode will reload and you will see a new dialog in the lower right corner indicating it is building the dev container.

You can click the **show log** link to see the output of the docker build that is running. This step can take a while as it will download and install all the necessary component for the PS Info Assistant Accelerator to build and deploy properly. Once this is complete you will have a docker container named "info-asst" in Docker Desktop on your developer workstation.

*If dev containers are new to you, take a minute and see what they are [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).*

## Configure Dev Container and ENV files

Now that the Dev Container is running, we need to set up your local environment variables. Open `scripts/environments` and copy `local.env.example` to `local.env`.

Open `local.env` and update values as needed:

Variable | Required | Description
--- | --- | ---
LOCATION | Yes | The location (West Europe is the default). The BICEP templates use this value.
WORKSPACE | Yes  | The workspace name (use something simple and unique to you). This will appended to infoasst-????? in your subscription.
REQUIRE_WEBSITE_SECURITY_MEMBERSHIP | Yes | Use this setting to determine whether a user needs to be granted explicit access to the website via an Azure AD Enterprise Application membership (true) or allow the website to be available to anyone in the Azure tenant (false). Defaults to false. If set to true, A tenant level administrator will be required to grant the implicit grant workflow for the Azure AD App Registration manually.
SKIP_PLAN_CHECK | No | If this value is set to 1, then the BICEP deployment will not stop to allow you to review the planned changes. The default value is 0 in the scripts, which will allow the deployment to stop and confirm you accept the proposed changes before continuing.
USE_EXISTING_AOAI | Yes | Set this value to "true" if you want to use an existing Azure Open AI service instance in your subscription. This can be useful when there are limits to the number of AOAI instances you can have in one subscription. Set the value to "false" and BICEP will create a new Azure Open AI service instance in your resource group.
AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME | No | If you have set **USE_EXISTING_AOAI** to "true" then use this parameter to provide the name of the Azure Open AI service instance in your subscription.
AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE_KEY | No | If you have set **USE_EXISTING_AOAI** to "true" then use this parameter to provide the Key for the Azure Open AI service instance in your subscription.
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_DEPLOYMENT | No | If you have set **USE_EXISTING_AOAI** to "true" then use this parameter to provide the name of a deployment of the "text-davinci-002" model in the Azure Open AI service instance in your subscription.
AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT | No | If you have set **USE_EXISTING_AOAI** to "true" then use this parameter to provide the name of a deployment of the "gpt-35-turbo" model in the Azure Open AI service instance in your subscription.
